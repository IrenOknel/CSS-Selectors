    <!-- Combinators
     A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
     There are four different combinators in CSS:
Descendant combinator (space)
Child combinator (>)
Next sibling combinator (+)
Subsequent-sibling combinator (~) 
-->

<!-- pseudo classes 
 A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a CSS selector that specifies a special state or
  characteristic of an element. It allows styling elements based on conditions beyond their
  basic structure, such as their state (e.g., hover, active, checked) or position within the document 
  (e.g., first-child, nth-child)-->
